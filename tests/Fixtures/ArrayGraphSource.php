/**
 * An in-memory {@see GraphSource} for certifying the relational driver family
 * WITHOUT a database — the source's only job is to yield nodes/edges/
 * gates, so an array-backed one exercises the family's hydrate-once contract
 * exactly like a real relational source would.
 *
 * `providesGates()` is what the factory reads to pick the governed vs spine-only
 * member; this fixture takes it as a constructor flag so a single class can back
 * both conformance runs. An EMPTY source (the default) lets the shipped
 * conformance kit seed its own fixtures through `putNode`/`putEdge`, proving the
 * family passes the same laws the in-memory reference driver does.
