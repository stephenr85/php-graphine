/**
 * THE GOVERNED MEMBER of the relational driver family.
 *
 * Everything {@see RelationalDriver} is (a spine hydrated once from a
 * {@see GraphSource}, all compute delegated), PLUS
 * role 4 — GOVERNANCE-AS-GATING. It loads host-asserted gates from the source's
 * `gates()` during hydration and answers `governedRank()` with the reference
 * spine's proven `score = gate · computed` law (`gate = 0` silences a node no
 * matter how central).
 *
 * The family is factory-selected: {@see RelationalDriverFactory} instantiates
 * THIS class iff the source declares a gate source, and the plain
 * {@see RelationalDriver} otherwise, so `instanceof GovernedStore` and
 * `supports(Capability::Governance)` stay in agreement (capability honest by
 * type, not a runtime flag).
 *
 * Governance rides OFF the structural spine — a gate is never a Node/Edge field
 * (the two-weights separation). `reason()` remains a
 * delegation signature only: the reference spine ships no in-process reasoner, so
 * this driver never advertises `Capability::Reasoning`. A consumer with a real
 * backend overrides `reason()` and adds the capability itself.
