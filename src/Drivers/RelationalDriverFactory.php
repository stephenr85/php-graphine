/**
 * Picks the right member of the relational driver family from the SOURCE.
 * A source that declares a gate source ({@see GraphSource::providesGates()})
 * yields the {@see GovernedRelationalDriver}; otherwise the plain
 * {@see RelationalDriver}.
 *
 * This is the whole reason the family is two classes rather than one runtime-
 * flagged one: the factory decides capability at WIRING time, so `instanceof
 * GovernedStore` narrows type-safely (the à-la-carte law) instead of every
 * caller re-checking a nullable governance flag.
 *
 * A consumer registers a driver with one line:
 *   $manager->extend('circuits', fn () => RelationalDriverFactory::make($source, 'circuits'));
