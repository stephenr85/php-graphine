/**
 * ROLE 4 — GOVERNANCE-AS-GATING. Optional, à-la-carte sub-contract layered
 * OVER the mandatory StructureStore + ComputeStore spine.
 *
 * The role-4 actually found in practice is NOT bitemporal
 * coherence — it is a host-asserted scalar that GATES role-2 compute output.
 * Earlier `Coherence`/`Bitemporal`/`Locality` DTOs had zero consumers and were
 * cut; so was the `?Coherence` field on Node/Edge — the exact anti-pattern this
 * contract forbids: governance leaking into the structural spine.
 *
 * Two load-bearing rules this contract encodes:
 *   1. The gate is a HOST-SIDE HINT. graphine guarantees only that it modulates
 *      governedRank(); its MEANING (what asserted_weight represents, how it's
 *      stored, the compute factors behind the computed score) stays consumer-
 *      side. It is never a Node/Edge schema field.
 *   2. Structural weight (Edge.weight, role 1/2) and the governance gate
 *      (role 4) are TWO DIFFERENT ROLES. One computes; the other gates the
 *      computed result. Fusing them is drift.
 *
 * Optionality is by TYPE, not by nullable field: a driver either implements
 * GovernedStore or it does not. `isGoverned()` becomes `$driver instanceof
 * GovernedStore`, decided at wiring time — not a per-node runtime null-check.
 * A consumer that never governs (e.g. Circuits) never implements this at all.
 *
 * The reference in-memory driver implements this so the conformance test-kit
 * can exercise the gating surface; real reasoning is always a consumer-side
 * backend behind a process boundary (never linked in-process — see the seam
 * guard). See research 04 for the full derivation.
