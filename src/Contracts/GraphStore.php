/**
 * THE SEAM — the wagon.
 *
 * `GraphStore` is the ONE coherent entry contract every driver implements. It
 * is deliberately SMALL: identity + capability introspection only. The four
 * roles hang off it as separate cohesive sub-contracts (StructureStore,
 * ComputeStore, QueryableStore, GovernedStore) that a driver composes as far
 * as it actually reaches.
 *
 * This is the explicit answer to "no monolithic god-interface": a driver that
 * only does role 2 implements GraphStore + ComputeStore and nothing else, and
 * `supports()` tells callers the truth. Role coverage across the ecosystem is
 * disjoint, so the contract models that disjointness instead of
 * lying about it.
 *
 * Manager-driver pattern (Illuminate\Support\Manager), laravel-popcorn-style:
 * config picks the default driver; runtime extend() adds more; the app resolves
 * `GraphStore` from the container and never names a concrete driver.
