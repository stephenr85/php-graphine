/**
 * THE GRAPH-SOURCE SEAM — the one thing that varies per consumer.
 *
 * A `GraphSource` sits between *how graph structure is stored* and *how it is
 * traversed*. It yields the nodes, edges, and (optional) governance gates of
 * some storage representation; the RelationalDriver family
 * hydrates them into the in-memory spine ONCE and answers every read —
 * including `getNode` — from that snapshot (a bounded-snapshot model).
 * The source is the only per-consumer variation; everything downstream (compute,
 * governance modulation, capability reporting) is shared.
 *
 * The three relational consumers (KG's rdf_triples, Circuits'
 * circuit_*, numero's archetype_interactions) proved to be the SAME move — pull
 * (from, to[, weight]) out of storage, hydrate, delegate all compute. That move
 * is the driver family; this interface is the only seam it leaves open.
 *
 * A source that yields gates (declared by {@see providesGates()}) selects the
 * GOVERNED member of the family; one that does not stays spine-only. The
 * capability the resulting driver advertises therefore stays honest BY TYPE
 * — the factory picks the class from the source.
 *
 * Constructed WITH ITS OWN SCOPE (a fragment id, a circuit id, a tenant): the
 * source closes over whatever it needs to read, so the driver stays scope-blind.
